This project implements inverse kinematics for a motion sensor system. The goal is to simulate or control articulated models (such as robotic arms or characters in 3D environments) based on input from real-world motion sensors. Inverse kinematics (IK) calculates the required joint angles to achieve a desired end-effector position, making it a critical component in robotics, animation, and virtual reality.

The Inverse-Kinematics-Motion-Sensor project is designed to be used together with Ureal Engine to simulate a character in real-time using sensor data.

Key components of this project include:

Motion sensor data processing
Inverse kinematics algorithm implementation
Real-time control and simulation of 3D models
Features
Real-time motion tracking: Uses sensor data to capture motion in real time.
Inverse kinematics solver: Computes joint angles from an end-effector's target position.
3D visualization: Provides an optional visualization of the articulated model in a simulated environment.
Flexible sensor input: Compatible with various motion sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes, IMUs).


Installation Prerequisites:
Python 3.8+
Libraries:
